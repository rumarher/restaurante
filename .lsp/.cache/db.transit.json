Basic DDL operations are also supported (create table, drop table,\naccess to table metadata).\n\nMaps are used to represent records, making it easy to store and retrieve\ndata. Results can be processed using any standard sequence operations.\n\nFor most operations, Java's PreparedStatement is used so your SQL and\nparameters can be represented as simple vectors where the first element\nis the SQL string, with ? for each parameter, and the remaining elements\nare the parameter values to be substituted.\n\nFor more documentation,

writes the .class file\n  to the *compile-path* directory.  When not compiling, does\n  nothing. The gen-class construct contains no implementation, as the\n  implementation will be dynamically sought by the generated class in\n  functions in an implementing Clojure namespace. Given a generated\n  class org.mydomain.MyClass with a method named mymethod, gen-class\n  will generate an implementation that looks for a function named by \n  (str prefix mymethod) (default prefix: \"-\") in a\n  Clojure namespace specified by :impl-ns\n  (defaults to the current namespace). All inherited methods,\n  generated methods, and init and main functions (see :methods, :init,\n  and :main below) will be found similarly prefixed. By default, the\n  static initializer for the generated class will attempt to load the\n  Clojure support code for the class as a resource from the classpath,\n  e.g. in the example case, ``org/mydomain/MyClass__init.class``. This\n  behavior can be controlled by :load-impl-ns\n\n  Note that methods with a maximum of 18 parameters are supported.\n\n  In all subsequent sections taking types, the primitive types can be\n  referred to by their Java names (int, float etc), and classes in the\n  java.lang package can be used without a package qualifier.

If not provided, defaults to Object.\n\n  :implements [interface ...]\n\n  One or more interfaces, the methods of which will be implemented by the class.\n\n  :init name\n\n  If supplied, names a function that will be called with the arguments\n  to the constructor.

This\n  parameter may be used to explicitly specify constructors, each entry\n  providing a mapping from a constructor signature to a superclass\n  constructor signature. When you supply this, you must supply an :init\n  specifier. \n\n  :post-init name\n\n  If supplied, names a function that will be called with the object as\n  the first argument, followed by the arguments to the constructor.\n  It will be called every time an object of this class is created,\n  immediately after all the inherited constructors have completed.\n  Its return value is ignored.\n\n  :methods [ [name [param-types] return-type], ...]\n\n  The generated class automatically defines all of the non-private\n  methods of its superclasses/interfaces. This parameter can be used\n  to specify the signatures of additional methods of the generated\n  class. Static methods can be specified with ^{:static true} in the\n  signature's metadata. Do not repeat superclass/interface signatures\n  here.\n\n  :main boolean\n\n  If supplied and true, a static public main function will be generated. It will\n  pass each string of the String[] argument as a separate argument to\n  a function called (str prefix main).\n\n  :factory name\n\n  If supplied, a (set of) public static factory function(s) will be\n  created with the given name, and the same signature(s) as the\n  constructor(s).\n  \n  :state name\n\n  If supplied, a public final instance field with the given name will be\n  created. You must supply an :init function in order to provide a\n  value for the state. Note that, though final, the state can be a ref\n  or agent, supporting the creation of Java objects with transactional\n  or asynchronous mutation semantics.\n\n  :exposes {protected-field-name {:get name :set name}, ...}\n\n  Since the implementations of the methods of the generated class\n  occur in Clojure functions, they have no access to the inherited\n  protected fields of the superclass. This parameter can be used to\n  generate public getter/setter methods exposing the protected field(s)\n  for use in the implementation.\n\n  :exposes-methods {super-method-name exposed-name, ...}\n\n  It is sometimes necessary to call the superclass' implementation of an\n  overridden method.  Those methods may be exposed and referred in \n  the new method implementation by a local name.\n\n  :prefix string\n\n  Default: \"-\" Methods called e.g. Foo will be looked up in vars called\n  prefixFoo in the implementing ns.\n\n  :impl-ns name\n\n  Default: the name of the current ns. Implementations of methods will be \n  looked up in this namespace.\n\n  :load-impl-ns boolean\n\n  Default: true.

core of the library is the \"is\" macro, which lets you make\n   assertions of any arbitrary expression:\n\n   (is (= 4 (+ 2 2)))\n   (is (instance? Integer 256))\n   (is (.startsWith \"abcde\" \"ab\"))\n\n   You can type an \"is\" expression directly at the REPL, which will\n   print a message if it fails.\n\n       user> (is (= 5 (+ 2 2)))\n\n       FAIL in  (:1)\n       expected: (= 5 (+ 2 2))\n         actual: (not (= 5 4))\n       false\n\n   The \"expected:\" line shows you the original expression, and the\n   \"actual:\" shows you what actually happened.  In this case, it\n   shows that (+ 2 2) returned 4, which is not = to 5.  Finally, the\n   \"false\" on the last line is the value returned from the\n   expression.  The \"is\" macro always returns the result of the\n   inner expression.\n\n   There are two special assertions for testing exceptions.  The\n   \"(is (thrown? c ...))\" form tests if an exception of class c is\n   thrown:\n\n   (is (thrown? ArithmeticException (/ 1 0))) \n\n   \"(is (thrown-with-msg? c re ...))\" does the same thing and also\n   tests that the message on the exception matches the regular\n   expression re:\n\n   (is (thrown-with-msg? ArithmeticException #\"Divide by zero\"\n                         (/ 1 0)))\n\n   DOCUMENTING TESTS\n\n   \"is\" takes an optional second argument, a string describing the\n   assertion.  This message will be included in the error report.\n\n   (is (= 5 (+ 2 2)) \"Crazy arithmetic\")\n\n   In addition, you can document groups of assertions with the\n   \"testing\" macro, which takes a string followed by any number of\n   assertions.  The string will be included in failure reports.\n   Calls to \"testing\" may be nested, and all of the strings will be\n   joined together with spaces in the final report, in a style\n   similar to RSpec <http://rspec.info/>\n\n   (testing \"Arithmetic\"\n     (testing \"with positive integers\"\n       (is (= 4 (+ 2 2)))\n       (is (= 7 (+ 3 4))))\n     (testing \"with negative integers\"\n       (is (= -4 (+ -2 -2)))\n       (is (= -1 (+ 3 -4)))))\n\n   Note that, unlike RSpec, the \"testing\" macro may only be used\n   INSIDE a \"deftest\" or \"with-test\" form (see below).\n\n\n   DEFINING TESTS\n\n   There are two ways to define tests.  The \"with-test\" macro takes\n   a defn or def form as its first argument, followed by any number\n   of assertions.  The tests will be stored as metadata on the\n   definition.\n\n   (with-test\n       (defn my-function [x y]\n         (+ x y))\n     (is (= 4 (my-function 2 2)))\n     (is (= 7 (my-function 3 4))))\n\n   As of Clojure SVN rev. 1221, this does not work with defmacro.\n   See http://code.google.com/p/clojure/issues/detail?id=51\n\n   The other way lets you define tests separately from the rest of\n   your code, even in a different namespace:\n\n   (deftest addition\n     (is (= 4 (+ 2 2)))\n     (is (= 7 (+ 3 4))))\n\n   (deftest subtraction\n     (is (= 1 (- 4 3)))\n     (is (= 3 (- 7 4))))\n\n   This creates functions named \"addition\" and \"subtraction\", which\n   can be called like any other function.  Therefore, tests can be\n   grouped and composed, in a style similar to the test framework in\n   Peter Seibel's \"Practical Common Lisp\"\n   <http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/practical-building-a-unit-test-framework.html>\n\n   (deftest arithmetic\n     (addition)\n     (subtraction))\n\n   The names of the nested tests will be joined in a list, like\n   \"(arithmetic addition)\", in failure reports.  You can use nested\n   tests to set up a context shared by several tests.\n\n\n   RUNNING TESTS\n\n   Run tests with the function \"(run-tests namespaces...)\":\n\n   (run-tests 'your.namespace 'some.other.namespace)\n\n   If you don't specify any namespaces, the current namespace is\n   used.  To run all tests in all namespaces, use \"(run-all-tests)\".\n\n   By default, these functions will search for all tests defined in\n   a namespace and run them in an undefined order.  However, if you\n   are composing tests, as in the \"arithmetic\" example above, you\n   probably do not want the \"addition\" and \"subtraction\" tests run\n   separately.  In that case, you must define a special function\n   named \"test-ns-hook\" that runs your tests in the correct order:\n\n   (defn test-ns-hook []\n     (arithmetic))\n\n   Note: test-ns-hook prevents execution of fixtures (see below).\n\n\n   OMITTING TESTS FROM PRODUCTION CODE\n\n   You can bind the variable \"*load-tests*\" to false when loading or\n   compiling code in production.  This will prevent any tests from\n   being created by \"with-test\" or \"deftest\".\n\n\n   FIXTURES\n\n   Fixtures allow you to run code before and after tests, to set up\n   the context in which tests should be run.\n\n   A fixture is just a function that calls another function passed as\n   an argument.  It looks like this:\n\n   (defn my-fixture [f]\n      Perform setup, establish bindings, whatever.\n     (f)  Then call the function we were passed.\n      Tear-down / clean-up code here.\n    )\n\n   Fixtures are attached to namespaces in one of two ways.  \"each\"\n   fixtures are run repeatedly, once for each test function created\n   with \"deftest\" or \"with-test\".  \"each\" fixtures are useful for\n   establishing a consistent before/after state for each test, like\n   clearing out database tables.\n\n   \"each\" fixtures can be attached to the current namespace like this:\n   (use-fixtures :each fixture1 fixture2 ...)\n   The fixture1, fixture2 are just functions like the example above.\n   They can also be anonymous functions, like this:\n   (use-fixtures :each (fn [f] setup... (f) cleanup...))\n\n   The other kind of fixture, a \"once\" fixture, is only run once,\n   around ALL the tests in the namespace.  \"once\" fixtures are useful\n   for tasks that only need to be performed once, like establishing\n   database connections, or for time-consuming tasks.\n\n   Attach \"once\" fixtures to the current namespace like this:\n   (use-fixtures :once fixture1 fixture2 ...)\n\n   Note: Fixtures and test-ns-hook are mutually incompatible.  If you\n   are using test-ns-hook, fixture functions will *never* be run.\n\n\n   SAVING TEST OUTPUT TO A FILE\n\n   All the test reporting functions write to the var *test-out*.  By\n   default, this is the same as *out*, but you can rebind it to any\n   PrintWriter.  For example, it could be a file opened with\n   clojure.java.io/writer.\n\n\n   EXTENDING TEST-IS (ADVANCED)\n\n   You can extend the behavior of the \"is\" macro by defining new\n   methods for the \"assert-expr\" multimethod.  These methods are\n   called during expansion of the \"is\" macro, so they should return\n   quoted forms to be evaluated.\n\n   You can plug in your own test-reporting framework by rebinding\n   the \"report\" function: (report event)\n\n   The 'event' argument is a map.  It will always have a :type key,\n   whose value will be a keyword signaling the type of event being\n   reported.  Standard events with :type value of :pass, :fail, and\n   :error are called when an assertion passes, fails, and throws an\n   exception, respectively.  In that case, the event will also have\n   the following keys:\n\n     :expected   The form that was expected to be true\n     :actual     A form representing what actually occurred\n     :message    The string message given as an argument to 'is'\n\n   The \"testing\" strings will be a list in \"*testing-contexts*\", and\n   the vars being tested will be a list in \"*testing-vars*\".\n\n   Your \"report\" function should wrap any printing calls in the\n   \"with-test-out\" macro, which rebinds *out* to the current value\n   of *test-out*.\n\n   For additional event types, see the examples in the code.\n","^;","^1>","^1G",17]],"^1H",[["^ ","^@",30,"^<",true,"^?",235,"^=",235,"^1A","^9W","^1J",235,"^1K",235,"^1Q","~$temp","^1L","^BF","^1D",14,"^>",14,"^1M",35,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/test.clj","^1N",39,"^;","^1H","^1G",235],["^ ","^@",32,"^<",true,"^?",236,"^=",236,"^1A","^BD","^1J",236,"^1K",236,"^1Q","^BE","^1L","^BF","^1D",14,"^>",14,"^1M",37,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/test.clj","^1N",42,"^;","^1H","^1G",236],["^ ","^@",28,"^<",true,"^?",237,"^=",237,"^1A","^7I","^1J",237,"^1K",237,"^1Q","^85","^1L","^BF","^1D",14,"^>",14,"^1M",33,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/test.clj","^1N",36,"^;","^1H","^1G",237]],"^1W",[["^ ","^@",39,"^<",true,"^?",235,"^=",235,"^1Q","^FO","^1L","^BF","^1D",14,"^>",35,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/test.clj","^;","^1W","^1G",235,"^1X","^9W"],["^ ","^@",42,"^<",true,"^?",236,"^=",236,"^1Q","^BE","^1L","^BF","^1D",14,"^>",37,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/test.clj","^;","^1W","^1G",236,"^1X","^BD"],["^ ","^@",36,"^<",true,"^?",237,"^=",237,"^1Q","^85","^1L","^BF","^1D",14,"^>",33,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/test.clj","^;","^1W","^1G",237,"^1X","^7I"]],"^1Y",[["^ ","^1?",250,"^1Z",["^ "],"^@",15,"^<",true,"^?",250,"^=",250,"^1@","1.1","^1[","^BF","^1A","~$*load-tests*","^21","~$clojure.core/defonce","^1D",1,"^>",3,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/test.clj","^1E",21,"^1F","True by default.

clojure.string). Instead, use require\nwith :as to specify a prefix, e.g.\n\n(ns your.namespace.here\n  (:require [clojure.string :as str]))\n\nDesign notes for clojure.string:\n\n1. Strings are objects (as opposed to sequences). As such, the\n   string being manipulated is the first argument to a function;\n   passing nil will result in a NullPointerException unless\n   documented otherwise. If you want sequence-y behavior instead,\n   use a sequence.\n\n2. Functions are generally not lazy, and call straight to host\n   methods where those are available and efficient.\n\n3. Functions take advantage of String implementation details to\n   write high-performing loop/recurs instead of using higher-order\n   functions. (This is not idiomatic in general-purpose application\n   code.)\n\n4. When a function is documented to accept a string argument, it\n   will take any implementation of the correct *interface* on the\n   host platform. In Java, this is CharSequence, which is more\n   general than String. In ordinary usage you will almost always\n   pass concrete strings. If you are doing something unusual,\n   e.g. passing a mutable implementation of CharSequence, then\n   thread-safety is your responsibility.","^;","^1>","^1G",9]],"^1Y",[["^ ","^25",["^1",[1]],"^1?",52,"^1Z",["^ "],"^@",22,"^<",true,"^?",48,"^=",48,"^1@","1.2","^1[","^7I","^1A","~$reverse","^21","^27","^1D",1,"^>",15,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/string.clj","^1E",45,"^28",["[s]"],"^1F","Returns s with its characters reversed.","^;","^1Y","^1G",48],["^ ","^25",["^1",[1]],"^1?",60,"^1Z",["^ "],"^@",35,"^<",true,"^?",54,"^=",54,"^1@","1.5","^1[","^7I","^1A","~$re-quote-replacement","^21","^27","^1D",1,"^>",15,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/string.clj","^1E",68,"^28",["[replacement]"],"^1F","Given a replacement string that you wish to be a literal\n   replacement for a pattern match in replace or replace-first, do the\n   necessary escaping of special characters in the replacement.","^;","^1Y","^1G",54],["^ ","^25",["^1",[3]],"^1?",109,"^1Z",["^ "],"^@",22,"^<",true,"^?",75,"^=",75,"^1@","1.2","^1[","^7I","^1A","^AH","^21","^27","^1D",1,"^>",15,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/string.clj","^1E",84,"^28",["[s match replacement]"],"^1F","Replaces all instance of match with replacement in s.\n\n   match/replacement can be:\n\n   string / string\n   char / char\n   pattern / (string or function of match).\n\n   See also replace-first.\n\n   The replacement is literal (i.e. none of its characters are treated\n   specially) for all cases above except pattern / string.\n\n   For pattern / string, $1, $2, etc. in the replacement string are\n   substituted with the string that matched the corresponding\n   parenthesized group in the pattern.

The interface will\n  have methods corresponding to the protocol functions, and the\n  protocol will automatically work with instances of the interface.\n\n  Note that you should not use this interface with deftype or\n  reify, as they support the protocol directly:\n\n  (defprotocol P \n    (foo [this]) \n    (bar-me [this] [this y]))\n\n  (deftype Foo [a b c] \n   P\n    (foo [this] a)\n    (bar-me [this] b)\n    (bar-me [this y] (+ c y)))\n  \n  (bar-me (Foo. 1 2 3) 42)\n  => 45\n\n  (foo \n    (let [x 42]\n      (reify P \n        (foo [this] 17)\n        (bar-me [this] x)\n        (bar-me [this y] x))))\n  => 17","^;","^1Y","^1G",713],["^ ","^1?",822,"^1Z",["^ "],"^@",13,"^<",true,"^?",777,"^=",777,"^1@","1.2","^1[","^2[","^1A","~$extend","^21","^27","^1D",1,"^>",7,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/core_deftype.clj","^1E",82,"^28",["[atype & proto+mmaps]"],"^54",1,"^1F","Implementations of protocol methods can be provided using the extend construct:\n\n  (extend AType\n    AProtocol\n     {:foo an-existing-fn\n      :bar (fn [a b] ...)\n      :baz (fn ([a]...)

implements a flexible system for printing structured data\nin a pleasing, easy-to-understand format. Basic use of the pretty printer is \nsimple, just call pprint instead of println. More advanced users can use \nthe building blocks provided to create custom output formats. \n\nOut of the box, pprint supports a simple structured format for basic data \nand a specialized format for Clojure source code. More advanced formats, \nincluding formats that don't look like Clojure data at all like XML and \nJSON, can be rendered by creating custom dispatch functions. \n\nIn addition to the pprint function, this module contains cl-format, a text \nformatting function which is fully compatible with the format function in \nCommon Lisp. Because pretty printing directives are directly integrated with\ncl-format, it supports very concise custom dispatch. It also provides\na more powerful alternative to Clojure's standard format function.\n\nSee documentation for pprint and cl-format for more information or \ncomplete documentation on the Clojure web

clojure.java.jdbc that support\n           the new clojure.datafy functionality in Clojure 1.10.\n\n           The whole schema/column lookup piece is very likely to change!\n\n           Currently, the :schema option for a 'query' function is a mapping\n           from column name to a tuple of table name, key column, and optionally\n           the cardinality (:one -- the default -- or :many). The cardinality\n           determines whether navigation should produce a single row (hash map)\n           or a result set.\n\n           One of the problems is that the general case -- query -- doesn't\n           have any concept of an associated table name (and may of course\n           join across multiple tables), so there's no good way to take the\n           table name into account when mapping a column to another table.\n\n           For find-by-keys and get-by-id, you do have the starting table\n           name so you could map [table1 column1] to [table2 column2] and have\n           table-specific mappings.\n\n           The obvious, logical thing would be to use SQL metadata to figure\n           out actual foreign key constraints but not everyone uses them, for\n           a variety of reasons. For folks who do use them, they can build\n           their schema structure from the database, and pass the relevant\n           part of it to the functions below (via :schema in options).","^;","^1>","^1G",14]],"^1H",[["^ ","^@",36,"^<",true,"^?",42,"^=",42,"^1A","^4?","^1J",42,"^1K",42,"^1Q","~$p","^1L","^V4","^1D",14,"^>",14,"^1M",41,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/java.jdbc/0.7.12/java.jdbc-0.7.12.jar::clojure/java/jdbc/datafy.clj","^1N",42,"^;","^1H","^1G",42],["^ ","^@",31,"^<",true,"^?",43,"^=",43,"^1A","^83","^1J",43,"^1K",43,"^1Q","~$jdbc","^1L","^V4","^1D",14,"^>",14,"^1M",36,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/java.jdbc/0.7.12/java.jdbc-0.7.12.jar::clojure/java/jdbc/datafy.clj","^1N",40,"^;","^1H","^1G",43]],"^1W",[["^ ","^@",42,"^<",true,"^?",42,"^=",42,"^1Q","~$p","^1L","^V4","^1D",14,"^>",41,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/java.jdbc/0.7.12/java.jdbc-0.7.12.jar::clojure/java/jdbc/datafy.clj","^;","^1W","^1G",42,"^1X","^4?"],["^ ","^@",40,"^<",true,"^?",43,"^=",43,"^1Q","^V5","^1L","^V4","^1D",14,"^>",36,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/java.jdbc/0.7.12/java.jdbc-0.7.12.jar::clojure/java/jdbc/datafy.clj","^;","^1W","^1G",43,"^1X","^83"]],"^1Y",[["^ ","^1?",45,"^1Z",["^ "],"^@",27,"^<",true,"^?",45,"^=",45,"^1[","^V4","^1A","~$datafy-result-set","^21","^3Z","^1D",1,"^>",10,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/java.jdbc/0.7.12/java.jdbc-0.7.12.jar::clojure/java/jdbc/datafy.clj","^1E",28,"^;","^1Y","^1G",45],["^ ","^1?",46,"^1Z",["^ "],"^@",20,"^<",true,"^?",46,"^=",46,"^1[","^V4","^1A","~$datafy-row","^21","^3Z","^1D",1,"^>",10,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/java.jdbc/0.7.12/java.jdbc-0.7.12.jar::clojure/java/jdbc/datafy.clj","^1E",21,"^;","^1Y","^1G",46],["^ ","^25",["^1",[4,3,5]],"^1?",117,"^1Z",["^ "],"^@",16,"^<",true,"^?",105,"^=",105,"^1[","^V4","^1A","^9C","^21","^27","^1D",1,"^>",7,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/java.jdbc/0.7.12/java.jdbc-0.7.12.jar::clojure/java/jdbc/datafy.clj","^1E",66,"^28",["[db table pk-value]","[db table pk-value pk-name-or-opts]","[db table pk-value pk-name opts]"],"^1F","Given a database connection, a table name, a primary key value, an\n  optional primary key column name, and an optional options map, return\n  a single matching row, or nil.\n  The primary key column name defaults to :id.","^;","^1Y","^1G",105],["^ ","^25",["^1",[4,3]],"^1?",140,"^1Z",["^ "],"^@",19,"^<",true,"^?",119,"^=",119,"^1[","^V4","^1A","^9B","^21","^27","^1D",1,"^>",7,"^:","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/java.jdbc/0.7.12/java.jdbc-0.7.12.jar::clojure/java/jdbc/datafy.clj","^1E",67,"^28",["[db table columns]","[db table columns opts]"],"^1F","Given a database connection, a table name, a map of column name/value\n  pairs, and an optional options map, return any matching rows.\n\n  An :order-by option may be supplied to sort the rows, e.g.,\n\n      {:order-by [{:name :asc} {:age :desc} {:income :asc}]}\n      ;; equivalent to:\n      {:order-by [:name {:age :desc} :income]}\n\n  The :order-by value is a sequence of column names (to sort in ascending\n  order) and/or maps from column names to directions (:asc or :desc).

The\n  root resource should contain code to create the lib's\n  namespace (usually by using the ns macro) and load any additional\n  lib resources.\n\n  Libspecs\n\n  A libspec is a lib name or a vector containing a lib name followed by\n  options expressed as sequential keywords and arguments.\n\n  Recognized options:\n  :as takes a symbol as its argument and makes that symbol an alias to the\n    lib's namespace in the current namespace.\n  :as-alias takes a symbol as its argument and aliases like :as, however\n    the lib will not be loaded. If the lib has not been loaded, a new\n    empty namespace will be created (as with create-ns).\n  :refer takes a list of symbols to refer from the namespace or the :all\n    keyword to bring in all public vars.\n\n  Prefix Lists\n\n  It's common for Clojure code to depend on several libs whose names have\n  the same prefix. When specifying libs, prefix lists can be used to reduce\n  repetition. A prefix list contains the shared prefix followed by libspecs\n  with the shared prefix removed from the lib names. After removing the\n  prefix, the names that remain must not contain any periods.\n\n  Flags\n\n  A flag is a keyword.\n  Recognized flags: :reload, :reload-all, :verbose\n  :reload forces loading of all the identified libs even if they are\n    already loaded (has no effect on libspecs using :as-alias)\n  :reload-all implies :reload and also forces loading of all libs that the\n    identified libs directly or indirectly load via require or use\n    (has no effect on libspecs using :as-alias)\n  :verbose triggers printing information about each load, alias, and refer\n\n  Example:\n\n  The following would load the libraries clojure.zip and clojure.set\n  abbreviated as 's'.\n\n  (require '(clojure zip [set :as s]))","^9","^:","^;",6038],["^ ","^<",["^=",[1]],"^>",6126,"^?",["^ "],"^@",24,"^A",true,"^B",6117,"^C",6117,"^D","1.10","^E","^F","^G","~$requiring-resolve","^1","^2","^3",1,"^4",7,"^5","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/core.clj","^6",79,"^7",["[sym]"],"^8","Resolves namespace-qualified sym per 'resolve'.

These\n  operations may be performed in parallel, but the results will\n  preserve order.","^9","^:","^;",51],["^ ","^<",["^=",[2]],"^>",79,"^?",["^ "],"^@",14,"^A",true,"^B",67,"^C",67,"^D","1.5","^E","^F1","^G","~$reducer","^1","^2","^3",1,"^4",7,"^5","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/core/reducers.clj","^6",78,"^7",["[coll xf]"],"^8","Given a reducible collection, and a transformation function xf,\n  returns a reducible collection, where any supplied reducing\n  fn will be transformed by xf. xf is a function of reducing fn to\n  reducing fn.","^9","^:","^;",67],["^ ","^<",["^=",[2]],"^>",97,"^?",["^ "],"^@",13,"^A",true,"^B",81,"^C",81,"^D","1.5","^E","^F1","^G","~$folder","^1","^2","^3",1,"^4",7,"^5","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/core/reducers.clj","^6",62,"^7",["[coll xf]"],"^8","Given a foldable collection, and a transformation function xf,\n  returns a foldable collection, where any supplied reducing\n  fn will be transformed by xf. xf is a function of reducing fn to\n  reducing fn.","^9","^:","^;",81],["^ ","^<",["^=",[2]],"^>",136,"^?",["^ "],"^@",16,"^A",true,"^B",128,"^C",128,"^D","1.5","^E","^F1","^G","^26","^1","~$clojure.core.reducers/defcurried","^3",1,"^4",13,"^5","zipfile:///home/raul/.m2/repository/org/clojure/clojure/1.11.1/clojure-1.11.1.jar::clojure/core/reducers.clj","^6",35,"^7",["[f coll]"],"^8","Applies f to every value in the reduction of coll.
